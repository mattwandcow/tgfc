# The TGFC Database

The TGFC is an art group that started on DeviantArt that shares Origonal Characters between members. When I joined, I didn't know everyone's characters, so I made a spreadsheet, detailing what I knew about the characters, and including links to thier users, their fight cards, and all the information that I felt was useful. Once made, I was the go-to guy for finding characters, even if I was still new to the group. I later spun the spreadsheet into a database, allowing me to do even more with it. Normalizing the data, adding alts, and so on.

This is version 5 of the Database.
